The data for this problem is provided in pokemon.txt and follows the
following format.
Col 1: pokemon_id: A unique identifier for the Pokemon.
Col 2: is_legendary: A 1 if the Pokemon is legendary, and 0 otherwise.
Col 3: height: The height of the Pokemon in meters.
Col 4: weight: The weight of the Pokemon in kilograms.
Col 5: encounter_prob: The probability of encountering this Pokemon 
in the wild grass. Note the sum of this entire column is 1, since when
you make an encounter, exactly one of these Pokemon appears.
Col 6: catch_prob: Once you have encountered a Pokemon, the probability 
you catch it. (Ignore any mechanics of the actual game if you've played 
a Pokemon game in the past.)
