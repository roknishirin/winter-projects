README.md : This file contains instructions on how to build and run the executables. 
# Building 

Run ```make``` to build the Order program.  
Run ```make clean``` to remove all binaries.  
Run ```make OrderCheck``` to run Order under valgrind on in5 junk5.  
Run ```make DictionaryCheck``` to run DictionaryTest under valgrind.
