# Programming Assginment 3: Depth First Search Algorithm

The purpose of this assignment is to implement a Graph ADT and some associated algorithms in C to ultimately find the adjacency list and the strongly connected components. 

# File Descriptions  

List.h : This file contains the List coding module interface.

List.c : This file contains the implementation of the List coding module.

Grah.c : This file contains the Graph coding module interface.

Graph.h : This file contains the implementation of the Graph coding module. 

GraphTest.c : This file contains a test for the Graph.c module. 

FindComponents.c : This file contains the implementation of the Graph coding module which takes an in and outfile and prints out the adjacency list and the strongly connected components.

Makefile : This file is responsible for doing the compilation process for the executable files. 

README.md : This file contains instructions on how to build and run the executables.

# Building

Run ```make``` to build the FindPath program.  
Run ```make clean``` to remove the binaries.   
Run ```make checkFind``` to test FindComponents for memory leaks on in7.
