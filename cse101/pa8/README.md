# Programming Assignment 8: Red-Black Tree

The purpose of this assignment is to implement a Dictionary ADT in C++ that is based on a Red-Black tree.  


# File Descriptions

Dictionary.h : This file contains the Dictionary coding module interface.  

Dictionary.cpp : This file contains the implementation of the Dictionary coding module.  

DictionaryTest.cpp : This file contains a test for the Dictionary coding module.  

Order.cpp : This file inserts the strings into a Dictionary. 

WordFrequency.cpp : This file sorts words with the frequency of each word. 

Makefile : This file is responsible for doing the compilation process for the executable files.   

README.md : This file contains instructions on how to build and run the executables. 

# Building 

Run ```make``` to build the WordFrequency program.   
Run ```make Order``` to build the Order program.    
Run ```make clean``` to remove all binaries.    
Run ```make WordFrequencyCheck``` to run WordFrequency under valgrind.    
Run ```make DictionaryCheck``` to run DictionaryTest under valgrind.
