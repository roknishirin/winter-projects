# Programming Assignment 5: C++ List ADT 

The purpose of this assignment is to implement a List ADT in C++ and to also use the List ADT to perform shuffling operations, and determing how many shuffles are necessary to bring a List back to its original order.  

# File Descriptions

List.h : This file contains the List coding module interface. 

List.cpp : This file contains the implementation of the List coding module.  

ListTest.cpp : This file contains a test for the List.cpp module.  

Shuffle.cpp : This file contains the implementation of the List coding module which will perform shuffling operations.  

Makefile : This file is responsible for doing the compilation process for the executable files.   

README.md : This file contains instructions on how to build and run the executables.  

# Building

Run ```make``` to build the Shuffle program.  
Run ```make ListTest``` to build the ListTest program.  
Run ```make clean```to remove all binaries.
