# Programming Assignment 1: Integer List ADT

Our goal in this project is to build an Integer List ADT in C and use it to indirectly alphabetize the lines in a file. 

# File Descriptions

List.h : This file contains the List coding module interface.

List.c : This file contains the implementation of the List coding module.

ListTest.c : This file contains a test for the List.c module.

Lex.c : This file contains the implementation of the Lex coding module which alphabetizes the lines in a file.

Makefile : This file is responsible for doing the compilation process for the executable files. 

README.md : This file contains instructions on how to build and run the executables.

# Building

Run ```make``` to build the Lex program.   
Run ```make ListClient``` to build the ListClient program.   
Run ```make ListTest``` to build the ListTest program.
