# Programming Assignmnet 6: C++ BigInteger ADT

The purpose of this assignment is to implement a BigInteger ADT in C++ that is capable of performing arithmetic operations on arbitararily large signed integers. 

# File Descriptions

List.h : This file contains the List coding module interface. 

List.cpp : This file contains the implementation of the List coding module.  

ListTest.cpp : This file contains a test for the List.cpp module.  

BigInteger.h : This file contains the BigInteger coding module interface.  

BigInteger.cpp : This file contains the implementation of the BigInteger coding module.  

BigIntegerTest.cpp : This file contains a test for the BigInteger.cpp module. 

Arithmetic.cpp : This file perofrms arithmetic operation on arbitrarily large signed integers. 

Makefile : This file is responsible for doing the compilation process for the executable files.   

README.md : This file contains instructions on how to build and run the executables.  

# Building 

Run ```make``` to build the Arithmetic program.  
Run ```make BigIntegerTest``` to build the BigIntegerTest program.  
Run ```make ListTest``` to build the ListTest program.  
Run ```make clean``` to remove all binaries.  
Run ```make ArithmeticCheck``` to run the Arithmetic program in valgrind on in4 junk4.  
Run ```make BigIntegerCheck``` to run the BigIntegerTest program in valgrind.  
Run ```make ListCheck``` to run the ListTest program in valgrind.
