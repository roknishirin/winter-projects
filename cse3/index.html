        My favorite website is one called the 
        <a href="https://www.boredbutton.com/"> <b> Bored Button</b> </a>. It allows me to have spontaneous content at the touch of a button.

        <br>

        Here is a picture of their iconic button:

        </center>

        Here are the reasons that I like using this website: 
        <ol>
            <li> 
                It is a website on the computer meaning I can destress during my breaks when coding. 
            </li>
            <li>
                It always offers different content meaning I will always be entertained 
            </li>
            <li>
                You can interact with the content on the screen, meaning that the entertainment is dynamic 
            </li>
        </ol>

        <br>

        Here are some other unordered reasons why I like using the website:
        <ul>
            <li> 
                The button is a gorgeous plastic red.
            </li>
            <li>
                The website itself has a very clean interface.
            </li>
            <li>
                The name 'bored button' is incredibly witty and charming.
            </li>
        </ul>
